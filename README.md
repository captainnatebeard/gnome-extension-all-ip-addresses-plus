# gnome-extension-all-ip-addresses-plus

This is a fork of the all-ip-addresses gnome extension, which is itself a fork of the lan-ip-addresses gnome extension
I've added functiionality for a "tun0" vpn interface (personally I see this particular interface a lot)
I've also updated the tool for use in gnome 42
